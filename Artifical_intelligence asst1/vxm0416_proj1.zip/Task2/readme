The evaluation function calucaltes
	 No. of 1,2,3 and 4 continues spots of same player in a row horizontally, vertically and both diagonals as well.

Note:
   1. Proof alpha beta pruning - for depth limit 8 , total no of leafs possible are 7^8 = 5,764,801‬. But the no of time evaluation functions is 
      called is 103,404. This means it pruned the branched in such a way that 5,661,397‬ leaves got eliminated.(you can verify this by uncommenting the line 
      number 15 in evaluation.py file).
   2. Program may be little slow with increasing depths but it tends to gets fast as the no of spots get filled, 
      the subroutine of the evaluation function i.e get counts has breaks and continue statements to eliminate rows and
      columns that no longer can contribute to increasing players score.
   3. The program always wins against a random opponent and sub-optimal opponent, makes a draw against a optimal opponent.
